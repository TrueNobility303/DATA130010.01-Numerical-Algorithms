# DATA130010.01-Numerical-Algorithms

This repo contains the codes and theoretical analysis for the course DATA130010.01-Numerical-Algorithms.

This course is an introduction to numerical algorithms, including

- solving non-linear equations
- fitting a function
- numericcal approximation 
- numerical integration
- numerical differentiation
- fast fourier transform
- numerical solution to ode and pde

I upload the codes since it can be viewed as an extension of MATLAB for some numerical algorithms. I put them here in case of need. Also hope them help if you are also struggling at this course.
